 === How to use this spec files===




All savanna services are wrappered into python virtualenv
to avoid conficts between python libs

So for each package you'll need openstack-savanna-virtualenv package.
First of all you will need to build openstack-savanna-virtualenv package, this
pakage just create root FS for virtualenv and need for any other part of savanna

Firt step:
rpmbuild -ba openstack-savanna-virtualenv.spec

You'll get openstack-savanna-virtualenv-0.1-1.el6.x86_64.rpm, please put in  into
SOURCE folder (e.g. /root/rpmbuild/SOURCE)


Second step:
To build all required packages  we need to download python sources. You can find all packets manually or use pip.
From my point of view, the fastest way is:
pip install --download '/path/to/SOURCEDIR' --no-install -r requirements.txt
requirements.txt - file from savanna disribution.

This command will download all requirements.


Now we are able to build all packages.
 
rpmbuild -ba <spec file> 

and put rpm into SOURCE dir

Please pay attantion:
1. ALL packages will install openstack-savanna-virtualenv during build and delete aftrer success build.
2. Some packages requires other pre-built RPMs in SOURCE dir
3. If build failed for some reason please check and removwe openstack-savanna-virtualenv-* packages manualy
